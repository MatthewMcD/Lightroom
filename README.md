## Lightroom Plug-in: Convert Tags to Flags
A simple plug-in to convert Colors or Stars to Lightroom Flags. I wrote this plug-in to solve a very simple problem I had incorporating Photo Mechanic into my workflow. In lightroom I use flags and Photo Mechanic only offers Rating or Color. This plug-in solves the problem by converting the selected option of colors or rating (stars) into flags: flagged, unflagged, or rejected. 

I have only tested it with [Adobe PhotoShop Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) CC 1015.10 (6.10.1.10) on Windows 10. You do not need [Photo Mechanic](http://www.camerabits.com/) 5.0 to make it work. Any external editor that supports color or rating will do provided, once imported into Lightroom, the rating and/or color labels show up.

### Installation
1. Download the folder tags2flags.lrdevplugin and all files contained within.
2. Open Lightroom and Launch the Plug-in Manager.
3. Click Add and select the tags2flags.lrdevplugin folder.
4. Configure the plug-in to use either Color or Rating and select the scheme you wish to use.
5. Close the Plug-in Manager.

### Using the plug-in
1. Select the images you wish to "convert".
2. While in the Library module, launch the plug-in: **Library | Plug-in Extras | Convert Colors to Flags**. On Windows you can use [ALT][L][U][L]. The colors or labels will be converted without confirmation. The changes are sent to the undo history in the event you need to roll them back.
