# Fujifilm Stars Tool
## Recover in-camera stars in Lightroom
If you use in camera rating with Fujifilm X-T2 (fw:3.0.0) the stars are applied to the JPG not the RAF. With the help of [ExifTool](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) this plugin reads the JPG stars and applies them to the RAF in lightroom.

## Props
This code uses the ExifUtils and Utils files from the [Focus Points](https://github.com/musselwhizzle/Focus-Points) project.
